"""UTF-8-safe decoding of ``requests`` responses (#89).

When a server returns a ``text/*`` body with no ``charset`` in its ``Content-Type``,
``requests`` follows RFC 2616 and decodes it as ISO-8859-1 — which mangles UTF-8
bytes into mojibake (``’`` becomes ``â€™``, ``…`` becomes ``â€¦``). Every raw fetch
site in the capture/crawl paths reads ``resp.text``, so charset-less UTF-8 pages
(the common case) were being corrupted before parsing.

`response_text` centralises the policy: honour an explicitly declared charset, but
when none is declared prefer the body's own sniffed encoding (``apparent_encoding``)
and fall back to UTF-8 — never the ISO-8859-1 default. A genuinely ISO-8859-1 page
that *declares* its charset is untouched and stays correct.

This module deliberately depends only on ``requests`` so every fetch site (web.py,
capture/job.py, graph/person_discovery.py) can import it without a cycle.

    can hold them, but encoding to UTF-8 — as the Gemini client does when serializing
    a prompt — raises ``UnicodeEncodeError: surrogates not allowed`` and kills the
    job. Untrusted crawled input must never be able to do that, so we replace each
    surrogate with the Unicode replacement character at the fetch/evidence boundary.
